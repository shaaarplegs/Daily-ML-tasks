    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this notebook, we explore a unique approach to generating textual data that pivots around a specific theme: chess. The primary aim is to create a flexible generator capable of producing sentences that are either related to the game of chess or entirely unrelated, based on a simple toggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Such data can be used to practise difficult vectorization techniques, ML vs NN  for this particular case which allows me to refresh my memory on the different applicable vectorization techniques in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Keyword Categorization: We categorize our vocabulary into two sets: one related to chess (e.g., \"pawn\", \"checkmate\", \"bishop\") and another comprising general words unrelated to chess (e.g., \"apple\", \"music\", \"running\"). This categorization serves as the foundation for thematic relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Parameter-Driven Generation: Through a Boolean parameter (about_chess), users can specify whether the generated sentence should be about chess. This simple yet effective method allows for flexibility in the type of data generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. Randomization Techniques: We use randomization to select words from the appropriate category, decide on the length of the sentence, and determine the placement of commas. This approach ensures that each generated sentence is unique and that there is a semblance of the unpredictability inherent in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. Iterative Development: The function is designed to iterate a variable number of times to construct a sentence. During each iteration, it randomly decides whether to add a word directly or to intersperse a comma, thereby creating a \"sentence\" that is a somewhat chaotic yet interesting assembly of words."
